= Get Your JAM on With Gatsby, React, and Netlify

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/[Gatsby] is a tool for creating static websites with React. It allows you to pull your data from virtually anywhere: content management systems (CMSs), Markdown files, APIs, and databases. Gatsby leverages GraphQL and webpack to combine your data and React code to generate static files for your website.

This is a demo script with the bare-bones steps you need to https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/02/18/gatsby-react-netlify[create a Gatsby app, deploy it to Netlify, and add a section that requires Okta for authentication].

TIP: The brackets at the end of some steps indicate the IntelliJ Live Templates to use. You can find the template definitions at https://github.com/mraible/idea-live-templates[mraible/idea-live-templates].

toc::[]

== Create a New Project with Gatsby

. Install prerequisites: Node 12+, a GitHub account, a Netlify account, and an Okta developer account

. Install Gatsby CLI

  npm install -g gatsby-cli

. Create a new Gatsby Project

  gatsby new gatsby-netlify-okta gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world

. Show project structure with `tree -I node_modules`

. Start app with `npm start` and view at `http://localhost:8000`

== Add Netlify CMS for Content Management

. Install Netlify CMS and its Gatsby plugin

  npm i netlify-cms-app@2.11.20 gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms@4.1.40

. In `gatsby-config.js`, register the Netlify CMS plugin

  module.exports = {
    plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms`],
  }

. Create `static/admin/config.yml`

  backend:
    name: test-repo
  media_folder: static/assets
  public_folder: assets
  collections:
    - name: blog
      label: Blog
      folder: blog
      create: true
      fields:
        - { name: path, label: Path }
        - { name: date, label: Date, widget: datetime }
        - { name: title, label: Title }
        - { name: body, label: Body, widget: markdown }

. Restart the app and show how you can edit content at `http://localhost:8080/admin`

== Integrate Netlify CMS with GitHub for Continuous Deployment

. Create a GitHub repo and add your project

  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add project to Git"
  git remote add origin git@github.com:${user}/${repo}.git
  git push origin master

. Setup Netlify to publish from GitHub: https://app.netlify.com/start

. Accept the default deploy settings and click **Deploy site**

. Scroll down to see progress in the **Production deploys** section

ðŸ’¥ You've built a React app, checked it into source control, and published it to production!

Not only that, but you automated the deployment process. Any changes you push to your GitHub repo will be automatically deployed by Netlify. ðŸ˜Ž

== Add Your GitHub Repo as a Netlify CMS Backend

. Modify `static/admin/config.yml` to use your GitHub repo:

  backend:
    name: github
    repo: your-username/your-repo-name

. Save `config.yml`, commit the change, and push it to your GitHub repo.

  git commit -a -m "Add GitHub Backend"
  git push origin master

. Wait for Netlify to finish deploying and navigate to your site's `/admin/` endpoint. You'll be prompted to log in with GitHub.

. Click **Login with GitHub** and you'll see a page that says "No Auth Provider Found".

. On Netlify, go to your **Site settings** and navigate to **Access control** > (scroll down) **OAuth**.

. Click **Install provider**. It will prompt you for a client ID and secret. To get this, navigate to https://github.com/settings/apps[GitHub Developer settings] > **OAuth Apps** > **New OAuth App**.

. Register a new application with the following settings:

* Application name: `My Gatsby Blog`
* Homepage URL: `<copy URL from Netlify>`
* Authorization callback URL: `https://api.netlify.com/auth/done`

. Go to your site's `/admin/` endpoint and log in with GitHub

. Create a post with `/blog/first-post` as the path

. Run `git pull origin master` locally and you'll see your project is updated

== Render Blog Posts with a BlogRoll React Component

. Create `src/components/BlogRoll.js` to query for blog posts using GraphQL [`gatsby-blog-roll`]

. Create a new page at `/src/pages/blog.js` for the blog index page [`gatsby-blog`]

. Add a link to it in `src/pages/index.js`:

  import React from 'react'
  import { Link } from 'gatsby'
  export default () => {
    return (
      <>
        Hello world!
        <p><Link to="/blog">View Blog</Link></p>
      </>)
  }

. Restart your Gatsby app using `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You'll receive an error because your project doesn't have Markdown support.

== Add Markdown Support to Gatsby

Gatsby's https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/[Add Markdown Pages docs] show the process that it uses to create pages from Markdown files.

. Install Gatsby plugins for Markdown support

  npm i gatsby-source-filesystem gatsby-transformer-remark

. Then configure them in `gatsby-config.js`:

  module.exports = {
    plugins: [
      `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms`,
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
        options: {
          path: `${__dirname}/blog`,
          name: `markdown-pages`,
        },
      },
      `gatsby-transformer-remark`
    ]
  }

. Restart everything and you'll be able to see your blog posts at `/blog`

. If you try to navigate into a blog, it won't work because you didn't tell Gatsby to generate pages for each one

== Use Gatsby's Node API to Generate Static Blog Pages

. Create a `gatsby-node.js` in the root directory of your project and add code to create a static page for each blog [`gatsby-node`]

. Create `src/templates/blog.js` [`gastby-blog-template`]

. Restart your app to see Markdown rendering properly!

. Commit your changes and verify everything works in production

  git add .
  git commit -m "Add /blog and Markdown support"
  git push origin master

== Add an Account Section

. Add an Account section for your site by creating a file at `src/pages/account.js` [`gatsby-account`]

. Add a link to the account page in `src/pages/index.js`

  <p><Link to="/account">My Account</Link></p>

. Since this section will have dynamic content that shouldn't be rendered statically, you need to exclude it from the build. Add the following JavaScript to the bottom of `gatsby-node.js` to indicate that `/account` is a client-only route.

  exports.onCreatePage = async ({ page, actions }) => {
    const { createPage } = actions;
    if (page.path.match(/^\/account/)) {
      page.matchPath = "/account/*";
      createPage(page)
    }
  };

. Let's make this section secure with Okta!

== Register Your App with Okta

. Create an Okta developer account at https://developer.okta.com if you don't already have one. Log in to your account.

. Navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**

  * Choose **Single-Page App** and **Next**
  * Enter a name like `Gatsby Account`
  * Specify the following Login redirect URIs:
    ** `http://localhost:8000/account`
    ** `http://localhost:9000/account`
    ** `https://<your-site>.netlify.com/account`
  * Specify the following Logout redirect URIs:
    ** `http://localhost:8000`
    ** `http://localhost:9000`
    ** `https://<your-site>.netlify.com`
  * Click **Done**

. Add Gatsby URLs as Trusted Origins in **API** > **Trusted Origins**. Click **Add Origin**, select **CORS** and **Redirect** for Type, and add each of the following:

  * `http://localhost:8000`
  * `http://localhost:9000`
  * `https://<your-site>.netlify.com`

== Protect Your Gatsby Account Section with Okta

. Install Okta's Sign-In Widget

  npm i @okta/okta-signin-widget@3.7.2

. Create a `Login` component in `src/components/Login.js` [`gatsby-login`]

. Replace the placeholders near the top of this file with your Okta app settings.

  const config = {
    baseUrl: '<okta-org-url>',
    clientId: '<okta-client-id>',
    ...
  };

. Modify `src/pages/account.js` to include an `Account` component that uses `Login` to get ID tokens and logout [`gatsby-account-okta`]

. Restart your app with `npm start`, open `http://localhost:8000` in a private window, and click on **My Account**. You'll be prompted to log in.

== Fix Gatsby Production Build

. To test building your app for production, run `gatsby build`

. Exclude Okta's Sign-In Widget from server-side rendering by configuring webpack. Add the following to the bottom of `gatsby-node.js`

  exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ stage, loaders, actions }) => {
    if (stage === 'build-html') {
      // Exclude Sign-In Widget from compilation path
      actions.setWebpackConfig({
        module: {
          rules: [
            {
              test: /okta-sign-in/,
              use: loaders.null(),
            }
          ],
        },
      })
    }
  };

. Try `gatsby build` again and it should work this time. Run `gatsby serve` to see if the production build works on `http://localhost:9000`. Rejoice when it does! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜ƒ

== Add User Registration

. To give people the ability to sign-up for accounts, go to your Okta dashboard > **Users** > **Registration**, and enable it.

. Modify `src/components/Login.js` to add Okta's user registration feature.

  const config = {
    ...
    authParams: {
      pkce: true,
      responseType: ['token', 'id_token']
    },
    features: {
      registration: true
    }
  };

. Then build for production and serve it up again.

  gatsby build
  gatsby serve

. You will now see a **Sign Up** link at the bottom of the login form

ðŸ¥³ Hooray - you did it! Check-in your code and rejoice in your new-found knowledge.

=== Extend Your Gatsby Account Functionality

Armed with Okta for authentication, you could develop features in the account settings of your application. For example, a setting where people can sign up for a newsletter (e.g., with https://tinyletter.com/[TinyLetter]). You could store this setting in Okta by creating a Node app that uses the https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-nodejs[Okta Node SDK] to update user attributes.

In fact, you might even develop a Java or .NET backend to handle this and communicate to it from your Gatsby application using `fetch()` and an OAuth 2.0 access token retrieved from the Sign-In Widget.

  async componentDidMount() {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('http://<node-server-url>/user/settings', {
        headers: {
          Authorization: 'Bearer ' + await signIn.authClient.tokenManager.get('accessToken')
        }
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      this.setState({ settings: data.settings });
    } catch (err) {
      // handle error as needed
      console.error(err);
    }
  }
